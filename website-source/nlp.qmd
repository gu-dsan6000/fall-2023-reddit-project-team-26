### Data Checks and Data Cleaning

In this section we performed standard NLP cleaning to clean reddit text data related to College Basketball. We then used that clean data to perform various analyses including identifying discussion on various topics related to college basketball, sentiment analysis of reddit posts, and linking reddit posts to the success of teams throughout the season. 

Let's look at the data before it is cleaned to get an understanding of the distribution of text data.

Distribution of text lengths in comments and submissions. 
:::
Here we see that the distribution of text lengths in submissions and comments is heavily right-skewed, but submissions are typically longer, which makes sense as people will write more in a post than in a comment. 

Identifying the most common words is also interesting, but looking at unclean data means the most common words will be “the”, “and”, “a”, etc. Which is not interesting. Lets clean the data first and then look at the most common words. 

The data is cleaned using the following steps: 
1. Tokenize: Create tokens from each word 
2. Remove Stopwords: Remove common words such as “the”, “and”, “or”, etc
3. Lower Case: convert all words to lowercase 
4. Normalize: remove non-standard words and digits, including emojis 
5. Lemmatize: lemmatize all words to group the same word in different forms

Using the clean data let's look at the most common words in our reddit data

The most common words in comments and submissions align with this being posts and comments about basketball. Words like team, game, final, and win are all sport related words. While there are differences between comments and submissions it's not very clear that there is any pattern in the differences between the top words. We also looked at TF-IDF scores to identify the most important words, the findings of this were not as relevant with words such as: “punish”, “harris”, and “load” being the most important words so we will not further discuss those scores. 

### Identifying Discussion Topics (Business Goals 5 & 6)

Two topics that are related to college basketball are the discussion about top players and the discussion of transfers and the transfer portal. We will look at both of these topics in our reddit data, using only the comments data as our submissions data is so limited. This section will answer business goals 5 and 6. 

*We edited Business goal 5 to remove looking at sentiment of players because the sentiment model was not completed yet. Business goal 6 was also changed so that we are not looking at specific transfers but at the discussion around transferring as a whole which was more time efficient.*

Players, especially the best, are heavily discussed among college basketball fans. Here we look at 9 of the best players of the 2021-2022 season. We chose these players based on their selection to first or second team all America. We removed “Johnny Davis” who was on first team all america but has such a common first and last name that we were worried about picking up discussion on other players with the same name. First we looked at the number of comments that mention each of the players. Kofi Cockburn, Keegan Murray, and Drew Timme have some of the highest mentions. It is interesting to see such a large difference in player mentions among the best players. This could be related to the team the player plays for or how flashy/controversial they are.

Over the course of the seasons, certain players also become more or less relevant. Here we see that over the course of the season, there is a lot of variability in which player is the most discussed. However, Keegan Murray and Jaden Ivey are definitely the most mentioned players overall. They were picked #4 and #5 in the 2022 NBA draft so it makes sense that they were so heavily discussed.

Since the NCAA became more flexible with transfers in 2020, there has been a creation of the transfer market in College Basketball. This has led to lots of discussion among whether this is good for the players, the sport, and fans. Additionally, fans talk a lot about who might be transferring and who their team could pick up in the transfer portal. Here we see how much the transfer process is discussed over the course of the season. Transfer discussion rises from January to May, with a spike from March to May. This makes sense because most players decide to transfer after the season is over, which for most teams is in March. This means fans are very reactionary in their discussion about transfers, only talking about it when players are starting to transfer, but not so much during the regular season.
